# PlanIt.io
This is an app that utilizes Google Maps to enable the user to plan trips. The app will automatically calculate and display the distance and duration between each destination that the user wishes to visit. In the end, the app will give the total duration and distance between all destinations that the user inputs.

## Limitations
1) At times, the map will not render the route info because of the inconsistent speed of retrieving the data. Hence, if the route information isn't displaying, simply restart the browser. 
2) When removing the route information from the list, the markers in the map are not removed. This is an issue that will need more time to figure out.
